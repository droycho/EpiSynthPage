# _Modulation Synthesizer_

#### _Java program focused on Audio/Visual synthesis and modulation, 5/20/2016_

#### By _**Ryan Carlile, LaTaevia Berry, Joseph Arnstein, DJ Roychoudhury**_

## Description

_This application is meant to simulate a basic audio-frequency modulation synthesizer. The display has a keyboard for a visual representation of a synthesizer keyboard, as well as a simulated "Kaoss Pad" which manipulates the filter frequency when the modulator is activated. The Frequency Modulator can be activated by clicking the mouse. The on-screen synthesizer is mapped to the users keyboard._

_Processing is used for the IDE to visually and sonically code the synthesizer_

_"Processing is an open source programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context, and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks." [-wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language))_

_The beads audio library was used to build all of the audio objects. [-The Beads Project](http://www.beadsproject.net/)_
